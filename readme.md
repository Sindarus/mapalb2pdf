MonAlbumPhoto.fr is a service that allows you to create custom photo albums to be physically printed. They used to provide a feature-rich windows desktop software for you to layout your album. This software would save photo albums under a custom file format. At some point, this software was abandonned in favor of a web-based software, and previously created photo albums could not be exploited anymore. This project, through reverse-engineering of the abandonned file format, allows to export old photo albums as PDFs.
